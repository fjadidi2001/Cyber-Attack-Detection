        "The **CICIDS2017 dataset** is a comprehensive collection of labeled network traffic data curated by the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity (CIC). It is widely used for evaluating the performance of intrusion detection systems (IDS) and benchmarking cybersecurity models.\n",
        "\n",
        "This dataset was created to reflect real-world scenarios by simulating benign and malicious traffic using realistic network environments, including both modern and legacy protocols. The data was generated using B-Profile systems, which emulate the behavior of human users based on statistical distributions. It captures traffic from a variety of attack types, making it suitable for training and testing both signature-based and anomaly-based IDS models.\n",

        "Key characteristics of the CICIDS2017 dataset include:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Time-stamped flow-based data** collected using CICFlowMeter.\n",
        "- **Multiple attack scenarios** such as DDoS, brute-force, botnet, infiltration, port scanning, web attacks, and more.\n",
        "- **Seven-day capture** (Monday to Sunday) with each day focusing on different attack types and benign traffic profiles.\n",
        "- **Features**: Over 80 network traffic features including flow duration, packet size, header flags, and inter-arrival times.\n",
        "- **Labeling**: Each traffic flow is labeled as either benign or one of the specific attack types.\n",
        "\n",
        "The CICIDS2017 dataset is particularly valuable for researchers and developers working on:\n",

        "- Unsupervised anomaly detection\n",
        "- Real-time traffic classification\n",
        "- Security policy and defense system testing\n",

        "By offering a well-structured and diverse dataset, CICIDS2017 helps bridge the gap between academic research and practical cybersecurity applications.\n",
